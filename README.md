Lung Cancer Detection using Python Program
This repository contains a Python program for detecting lung cancer from CT images. The program uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify suspicious nodules or lesions in the lungs.

The program is implemented using Python and the Flask web framework for the user interface. The user interface allows users to upload CT images, which are then processed and analyzed by the machine learning algorithms. The results of the analysis are displayed to the user, including the probability of the presence of lung cancer.
